**Voice-powered expense tracker for budget-conscious travellers.**

SayPay lets you log travel expenses hands-free — just tap a button and say
"I spent 20 euros on lunch." The app uses AI to parse your voice input and
instantly records the expense against your trip budget, so you always know
where your money is going.
